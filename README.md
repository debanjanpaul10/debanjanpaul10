I'm an Electrical Engineering Student graduating with a Bachelor's Degree from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology in the month of July 2021. I have some coding 'kink' as it can be described and also have some good knowledge on both latest coding techniques as well as good in-depth knowledge on Electrical Engineering Skills.
As of now I'm currently working on towards developing both my personality traits and also my coding skills so as to land a good job in an enthusiastic work environment.
Hoping to do something valuable to be an Arctic Vault contributor.
### Kudos !!! 😄😄❤️❤️❤️
